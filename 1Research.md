<h2>What the NEETs need? The Effect of Activation Policies and Cash Transfers</h2> <a href="slides_jun2021.pdf">Slides</a> - Working paper available on request

<img src="gj.png" ALIGN="right" width="400" height="500">Youth Neither in Employment, Education or Training (NEETs) were a severe problem in the last decade in Europe, regaining relevance with the Covid-19 crisis. Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) are a primary response, but effectiveness depends on the mix of services offered. Accompanying ALMPs with cash transfers could augment participation and ease financial constraints, but also decrease search effort. This paper evaluates a French program targeting disadvantaged NEETs between 16 and 25 years old, *Garantie Jeunes*, which combines cash transfers, soft-skills training and intensive job-search assistance for a year. I develop a tailored diff-in-diff methodology for identifying ITT and LATE in a setting with staggered adoption and units subsequently exposed to treatment at different tenures. I highlight strong positive effects of the program on employment, earnings and hours worked: after one year of exposure to *Garantie Jeunes*, the probability of employment increased by 1.7 points, hours worked by 5, and earnings by 61 euros on a quarterly basis, which translates in a LATE of +28 percentage points in the probability of employment, +81 hours worked and +1004 Euros of earnings. There is no evidence of lower employability while participating to the program and receiving the cash transfer. These large effects come with a cost: the Marginal Value of Public Funds of *Garantie Jeunes* is estimated at 1.5.

<img src="treatment.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600">This paper studies the incidence and welfare effects of a particular kind of training subsidies, Individual Learning Accounts (ILA). We exploit a natural experiment provided by the reform of a French ILA, the \textit{Compte personnel de formation} (CPF). First, we theoretically model the impact of changing the per-hour subsidy rate on demand and supply for training, using a simple partial equilibrium model. Informed by this, we study the impact of a reform of 2019, which differentially lowered the per-hour value of the CPF subsidy across industries. We highlight three results. First, the supply of training is between 15% and 50% less elastic than demand, so that more than half of the benefit of the subsidy is captured by training producers. Second, total hours of training undertaken are not significantly affected by subsidy changes, leading to estimates of demand and supply elasticities which are close to zero. This makes CPF subsidy a simple transfer to producers and trainees. The silver lining is that, when studied through the lenses of a sufficient statistics framework, the efficiency cost of CPF is also low. Third, we use data on revenues and expenses of training to see that the reduction of the subsidy eventually translates in a reduction of producers' profits, with no effect on labor costs and employment of trainers.

<h2>Did Covid-19 hit harder in peripheral areas? The case of Italian municipalities" just got published on Economics and Human Biology</h2>

  <img src="extra_march_by_classe.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600">The first wave of Covid-19 pandemic had a geographically heterogeneous impact even within the most severely hit regions. Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). We leverage a rich dataset on Italian municipalities to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. We first show that socio-demographic and economic features at municipal level are highly collinear, making it hard to identify single-variable causal relationships. Using Principal Components Analysis we model excess mortality and show that areas with higher excess mortality have lower income, lower education, larger households, lower trade and higher industrial employments, and older population. Our findings highlight a strong centre-periphery gradient in the harshness of Covid-19, which we believe is also highly relevant from a policy-making standpoint.
