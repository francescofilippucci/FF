<h2>What the NEETs need? The Effect of Activation Policies and Cash Transfers</h2> <a href="slides_jun2021.pdf">Slides</a> - Working paper available on request

<img src="gj.png" ALIGN="right" width="300" height="400">Youth Neither in Employment, Education or Training (NEETs) were a severe problem in the last decade in Europe, regaining relevance with the Covid-19 crisis. Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) are a primary response, but effectiveness depends on the mix of services offered. Accompanying ALMPs with cash transfers could augment participation and ease financial constraints, but also decrease search effort. This paper evaluates a French program targeting disadvantaged NEETs between 16 and 25 years old, \textit{Garantie Jeunes}, which combines cash transfers, soft-skills training and intensive job-search assistance for a year. I develop a tailored diff-in-diff methodology for identifying ITT and LATE in a setting with staggered adoption and units subsequently exposed to treatment at different tenures. I highlight strong positive effects of the program on employment, earnings and hours worked: after one year of exposure to \textit{Garantie Jeunes}, the probability of employment increased by 1.7 points, hours worked by 5, and earnings by 61 euros on a quarterly basis, which translates in a LATE of +28 percentage points in the probability of employment, +81 hours worked and +1004 Euros of earnings. There is no evidence of lower employability while participating to the program and receiving the cash transfer. These large effects come with a cost: the Marginal Value of Public Funds of \textit{Garantie Jeunes} is estimated at 1.5.
