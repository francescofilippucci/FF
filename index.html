  <h3>My paper "Did Covid-19 hit harder in peripheral areas? The case of Italian municipalities" just got published on Economics and Human Biology</h3>
  In this work, joint with Francesco Armillei (Bocconi University) and Thomas Fletcher (University of Edimburgh), I analyze the geographically heterogeneous impact of Covid-19. xploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). 
  We leverage the rich dataset of the <a href="https://www.localopportunitieslab.it/">Local Opportunities Lab</a> to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X21000423">Check it up!</a>
