    I am a PhD candidate in labor and public economics at the Paris School of Economics. 
    Here you can find my <a href="https://francescofilippucci.github.io/website/1Research.html">research</a>, my <a href="https://francescofilippucci.github.io/website/2Policy.html">policy work</a>, my <a href="mailto:francesco.filippucci@psemail.eu">contacts</a> and <a href="FF_CV.pdf">resume</a>.

  <h2>News from me</h2> 
  <h3>I will be on the academic job market this winter</h3>
  <p>
  <img src="gj.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600"> My job market paper, titled "What Do NEETs Need?
	The Effect of Combining Activation Policies and Cash Transfers" first investigates the effect of jointly providing active and passive labor market policies. 
  I exploit a large French program for disadvantaged NEETs, <i>Garantie Jeunes</i>. 
  I develop an extension of recent methodological innovations in the field of diff-in-diff, where I "roll" over a third dimension.  
  I find that activation measures compensate for negative effects of lock-in, implicit taxation from cash-transfer phase out, and disincentives to work by the cash transfer.

  <h3>My paper "Did Covid-19 hit harder in peripheral areas? The case of Italian municipalities" got published on Economics and Human Biology</h3>
  <img src="extra_march_by_classe.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600"> In this work, joint with Francesco Armillei (Bocconi University) and Thomas Fletcher (University of Edinburgh), I analyze the geographically heterogeneous impact of Covid-19. Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). 
  We leverage the rich dataset of the <a href="https://www.localopportunitieslab.it/">Local Opportunities Lab</a> to explore mechanisms behind this gradient.
