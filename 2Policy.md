  With my policy work I aim at having an impact on the communities I belong to. I am a founding member of the Local Opportunities Lab and of the think tank Tortuga. My contributions to the public debate appear in national press and specialized blogs.

<h2>The Local Opportunities Lab</h2> <a href="https://www.localopportunitieslab.it/">localopportunitieslab.it</a>


<img src="lol.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600">The Local Opportunities Lab is the first hub in Italy on local data, opportunities and inequalities. The mission of the Lab is to promote scientific research and data-driven policy on local economies e geographical inequalities, study the efficiency and equity of public
policies and support projects that aim at having an impact at the micro-economic level. The Lab is built on 4 pillars. First, a network of researchers and institutions focusing on the study of socio-economic phenomena at the local level. Second, a dataset that collects and harmonizes a large number of variables at the municipality or sub-municipality level and within a
wide time window. Third, a research incubator for supporting, publishing and diffusing contents on local economies (both for public and academia). Finally, a support tool for private and public institutions, interested in running research and projects using the data. 

<h2>Tortuga</h2> <a href="https://www.tortuga-econ.it/">tortugaecon.eu</a>

<img src="tortuga.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600">Tortuga is the first think tank of young economists in Italy. Tortuga produces analysis and research on economic and political current affairs, develops policy proposals and supports institutions in the field of policy-making. Started by 6 students in 2015, nowadays counts more than 50 associates. The mission of tortuga is to promote growth and equity, particularly inter-generational equity, through a more efficient policy-making in Italy. In 2019 we wrote a book, "Ci Pensiamo Noi", launching 10 policy proposals for youths in Italy.
