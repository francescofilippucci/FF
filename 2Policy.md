  With my policy work I aim at having an impact on the communities I belong to. I am a founding member of the Local Opportunities Lab and of the think tank Tortuga. My contributions to the public debate appear in the press and in specialized blogs.

<img src="lol.png" ALIGN="right" width="500" height="600">The Local Opportunities Lab is the first hub in Italy on local data, opportunities and inequalities. The mission of the Lab is to promote scientific research and data-driven policy on local economies e geographical inequalities, study the efficiency and equity of public
policies and support projects that aim at having an impact at the micro-economic level. The Lab is built on 4 pillars. First, a network of researchers and institutions focusing on the study of socio-economic phenomena at the local level. Second, a dataset that collects and harmonizes a large number of variables at the municipality or sub-municipality level and within a
wide time window. Third, a research incubator for supporting, publishing and diffusing contents on local economies (both for public and academia). Finally, a support tool for private and public institutions, interested in running research and projects using the data.
